        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>My dad was born in 1964 in California, and my mom was born in Albania. She left the country, went to Italy for 6 months, and eventually made it to California when she was 19. I also have an older brother named Roger who is 3 years older than me.</p>
        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>I feel like I am very skilled in a program called SketchUp, a 3D modeling program. I also feel like I'm skilled in other programs like Illustrator, Floor Planner, and HTML (also CSS). And I do have skills in karate, a sport that I used to do.
