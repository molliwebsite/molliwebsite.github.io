        <h2>What is the issue?</h2>
        <p>People who don't suffer from mental disorders just assume things about people with them. The people who suffer from them are strong, not weak.</p>
        
        <h3>Misconceptions about Mental Disorders</h3>
        <h5>1. Mental Disorders don't affect young children. Any problem for them is just them growing up</h5>
        <p>In reality, one out of five children struggle with mental health. 70% of adult's mental illnesses begins during childhood or teenage years.</p>
        <h5>2. It's the parent's fault if their child has mental illness</h5>
        <p>This isn't the case at all. Mental disorders are caused by biology, environment, or a combination of both. It can also be caused by genetics, biological factors, abuse, neglectful treatment, or stressful events.
        <h5>3. People with a mental illness are "psycho", mad and dangerous, and should be locked away</h5>
        <p>Most that are affected by mental illnesses struggle with depression or anxiety. They live like normal people, but their feelings and behavior can affect their daily activity. The only primary reason for a referral to a children's mental health agency, it if the child is struggling with conduct disorders or acting out behaviours.</p>
        <h5>4. All people with Schizophrenia are violent</h5>
        <p>Little violence in society is caused byb people who are mentally ill. Sadly, Hollywood will often portray mentally ill people as dangerous. People with mental illnesses are more likel to be victims of violence rather than the cause.</p>
        <h5>5. Depression is a character flaw and peole should just "snap out of it"</h5>
        <p>Depression has nothing to do with being lazy or weak. It can result from changes in brain chemistry or brain function. Therapy and/or medication may help people recover.</p>
        <h5>6. People with a mental illness lack intelligence</h5>
        <p>In reality, being smart has nothing to do with mental illnesses or brain disorders. You may find people with mental illnesses who are brilliant, creative, and productive people, or some that aren't. Certain mental disorders may make it difficult for some to remember facts or get along with people, making it challenging for them. Overall, it doesn't make someone not smart if they have a mental disorder.</p>
        <h5>7. Mental illness is a single, rare disorder</h5>
        <p>Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, addiction disorders, and impulse control disorders are all different categories of different mental illnesses. Each of them have its own features and causes. Each of them can also affect someone in differnt ways.</p>
        <h5>8. People with a mental illness can never get better</h5>
        <p>Treatment does work! Treatments for different mental disorders have been increasing, and researchers continue to discover new treatments. Because of all the options, many people who are mentlly ill, do and can recover from their mental disorder.</p>
        <h5>9. Mental illness is a sign of weakness</h5>
        <p>Some people just assume that others with mental disorders are mentally "weak". Depending on how major the mental disorder is, just by living with it and acting like everyone else in society, they are strong. Others can even envy them for living with it.</p>
        <h5>10. Mental Illness is an adult problem</h5>
        <p>Not just adults, but children are capable of dealing with anxiety, depression, etc. The actual rate of kids having mental disorders is way higher than we all think.</p>
