    <h2>My Future</h2>
    
    <h3>High School</h3>
    <p> I really have no idea what high school I'm going to. Because my brother is at Lakewood High School, it will be easier for my parents if I go there. For their benefit, I'll most likely go to Lakewood.</p> 
    <h3>College</h3> 
    <p<Again, I really have no clue what college I want to go to. I don't even know what colleges are in my area. I'll most likely turn to my mom to help me pick out a college.</p>
    <h2>Carreer Interests</h2>
    <p>I guess I'm a little intrested in doing something with photography. Besides that, I don't really know what to do with my life. I just don't get how people can have their life all planned out, and I'm stuck figuring out whhat I even want to do with my life.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>All I really want to do is just to succeed in life. This can make my parents proud of me, something that I want. I also want to stop acting like a different person in front of other people and to trying to fight my GSAD.</p>
