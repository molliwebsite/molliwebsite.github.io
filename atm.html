    <h1>About ATM</h1>
  
      <h2>What is the ATM Program?</h2>
    <p>ATM is an acronym for Applied Technology Magnet, a three year program at Bancroft Middle School. In ATM, the students learn different programs, different techniques, and how to use the computer.</p>
      <h3>6th Grade</h3>   
     <p>During 6th grade ATM, we learned about typing, Microsoft Programs, and how to use a computer</p>

        <p>During the short time I've been in the ATM program in 8th grade, we learned about making websites, coding, and visual studio code</p>

                <h2>Reflection of the ATM Program</h2>
                    <p class="relection">Overall, I think that the ATM program was a great class that I had in middle school. It taught me a lot about computers and differnt programs that most people in my family didn't know about. Technology classes can be very useful to students, and they should be offered at most schools.</p>
