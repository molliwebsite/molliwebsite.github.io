                <h2>Reflection of the ATM Program</h2>
                    <p class="relection">Overall, I think that the ATM program was a great class that I had in middle school. It taught me a lot about computers and differnt programs that most people in my family didn't know about. Technology classes can be very useful to students, and they should be offered at most schools.</p>
